# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-using-CNN


In this project I have a zipped file which contains four different folders having images. My goal was to create image classification for all.

I made this project on google colab which I am very familiar with. To start with the model I unzipped the folders, created new directories and split the images into training and validation sets.  

Next step I used Data Augmentation technique to make the data rich and sufficient to make the model perform better and accurately.

By using CNN Modelling I trained the model which gave me an Accuracy score of0.886.
